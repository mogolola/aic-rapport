\section{Hurricane Trajectory Forecasting}
\label{sec:chapter2_1}
Cyclones, hurricanes or typhoons are words for the same phenomena: a rare and complex event characterized by strong winds surrounding a low pressure area. Hurricanes is one of the most severe natural disaster that cost tremendous damage and death in each year. An average hurricane can release as much energy in a day as explosion of half a million small atomic bombs. Since 2000, over 45000 people were killed by hurricanes. In 2005, hurricane Katrina has cost as much as 125 billions US Dollars worth of damage. In 2010, It is estimated that 1.53 billion people live in hurricanes prone areas in 81 different countries and territories. 133.7 millions of people is exposed to hurricanes, the number has increased three times compared to the year 1970, which also raise the risk of potential damage made by hurricanes in the future.\cite{peduzzi2012global}. That makes the forecast of hurricane trajectory so important, if we know when and where the hurricanes is going to make landfall, people live in that area will be alarmed and get some time to protect their goods and evacuate. Improving the prediction of hurricane movements have enormous significance on society.

\subsection{Formation of Hurricanes}
The evolution and path of hurricanes depends on many factors at different scales and altitudes. All hurricanes are formed over warm ocean water near the equator. The warm and moist air over the ocean rises upward, which cause low pressure area below. Air from surrounding areas with higher pressure flow over into the low pressure area, and the new air are heated and rise upward again. As the warm and moist air rise and cools off, the water in the air forms clouds. The storm grows up and rotate as the cycle continue fed by ocean's heat and water evaporating from the surface. When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39mph, the storm is called a "tropical storm". When the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially called a "tropical cyclone", or hurricane. The Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS), classifies hurricanes into 5 categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds. The highest classification in the scale, category 5, consists of storms with sustained wind speeds higher than 156mph.

Hurricane can be very unpredictable. The movement of hurricane sometimes performs loops, hairpin turns, and sharp curves. Its intensity can also change violently in a very short time. In 2005, After hurricane Katrina made its first landfall in Florida it was only classified as tropical storm. After emerged into Gulf of Mexico, it rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane and its second landfall finally caused the largest damage from natural disaster in history. Global warming is also considered to influence hurricane activities. it is estimated that global warming will cause hurricanes in the coming century to be more intense globally and have higher rainfall rates than present-day hurricanes , which may lead to both more representative and more consistent error statistics.


\subsection{Forecast Method for Meteorologists}
Tracks and intensity are the two main goal of the forecast. Today, the forecasts (track and intensity) are provided by a numerous number of guidance models \cite{nhc_models}. The original best model was statistical model based on historical relationships between storm behavior and various other parameters and it was the major forecasting model until 1980's \cite{demaria2005further}. Today it is mostly used for testing and comparing new models. Dynamical models solve the physical equations governing motions in the atmosphere. If they can have quite precise results, they are computationally demanding. If the computation last for days, it wouldn't make sense to make prediction since the prediction will already be out of date. The statistical model, in contrast, does not demand high computational cost, but are less accurate than dynamic models. Current national forecasts are typically driven by consensus methods able to combine different dynamical models.






\section{Internship Subject}
\label{sec:subject}
In this work, we propose a neural network architecture taking into account past trajectory data and reanalysis atmospheric wind fields and geopotential fields images. This fused network estimates the longitude and laritude 24h-forecast of hurricanes and depressions from both hemispheres and different basins (more than 3000 storms since 1979)....
