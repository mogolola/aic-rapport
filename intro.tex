\section{Internship Subject}
\label{sec:subject}
This internship is \textbf{(where is the internship comes from...)} The objective of the internship is to study for using deep learning as alternative methodology for hurricane trajectory forecasting. We propose a neural network architecture taking into account past trajectory data and reanalysis atmospheric physical fields images. This fused network estimates the longitude and latitude 6h-72h forecast of hurricanes and depressions from both hemispheres and different basins (more than 3000 storms since 1979). We then compare our forecast results with results of NHC's models, including a representative early model BCD5 and their official model OCFL.
