\chapter{Conclusion and Discussion}

We showed a promising deep learning framework for storm track forecasting. We demonstrated the benefit of coupling four types of data (wind fields, pressure fields, past tracks and other hand crafted data) in an efficient fusion model. 

...

We think that the use of such deep learning methods can help the current forecast modellers by providing a complementary prediction that could be integrated in some consensus methods.
